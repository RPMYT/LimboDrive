A Minecraft science fiction/fantasy mod about space, with a side of old-school pixel-style JRPGness...
<br/>
...and a generous helping of D&D 5e homebrew.
<br/>

## Authors
Originally made for BlanketCon 23 cyber/NOVA, by Lilirine (RPMYT).

Takes inspiration from a lot (and I mean a *lot*) of other media: <br/><br/>
    - JRPGs (MOTHER series, Final Fantasy [though not as much], some RPG Maker games, that sort of thing)
    <br/>
    - Tabletop RPGs (D&D 5e. That's it)

All credit for ideas yoinked from such media goes to their original creators.

## TODO
This list is in order of priority.

- Starfield:
  - Generation
  - Navigation
  - Planets:
    - Generation
    - Landing (auto)
    - Landing (crewed)
    - Exploration
    - Statistics (population etc)
    - Semi-realtime simulation
  
- Lifeforms:
  - Generation on planets
  - Speech banks
  - Recruiting
  - Combat:
    - Turn-based JRPG-style ("classic") system:
      - Levelups
      - Staple JRPG stats: speed, attack, etc
      - Per-quadrant and per-sector relative enemy difficulty
      - Enemy drops. Lots of them.
    
    - Semi-turn-based D&D 5e style ("tabletop") system:
      - Some levelups
      - 5e stats, weapons etc
      - Semi-relative semi-absolute enemy difficulty
      - Not as many item drops, prefer money and EXP
    
    - Money, item, and EXP systems
    - Semi-autonomy system (main) with combat and shopping rule creation
    - No-autonomy system (max. four NPCs) with direct control of combat, shopping, etc
